# Dual N-Back with Intervals



First, you should load six pictures named 1.jpg, 2.jpg,..., 6.jpg into the images folder. This is 
a dual n-back game, where "dual" means you will receive a picture and a piano sound. You also have 
to type the interval between the current and previous sound. There are 12 sounds, all different and 
within one octave, and 6 pictures. When dealing with intervals, you type the number n (-11 <= n <= 11), 
which signifies how many semitones apart the presented piano sounds are. Due to some issues with 
the playsound() function, files containing sounds are named using alphabet letters.
